# Pulse Propagation in Dense Atomic Vapours - Analysis
This research is based on the Thesis of Thomas P. Ogden. Which demonstrated the simulation and the theory of a electromagnetic wave propagating in a Dense Atomic vapour. In this research we are working with the thesis given [here](https://github.com/tpogden/phd-thesis.git) and the [code](https://github.com/tpogden/maxwellbloch.git)
